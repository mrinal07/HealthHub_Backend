Recommended Alternative Approach: Transactional Flow with Retry Mechanism
Use a combination of both approaches with a two-phase commit-like logic:

Steps:
Save Metadata as PENDING_UPLOAD in MongoDB:

Record the file details (except Drive ID) in MongoDB with a PENDING_UPLOAD status.
Upload File to Google Drive:

Attempt to upload the file to Google Drive.
If the upload succeeds, retrieve the Drive ID.
Update MongoDB Record:

Update the record in MongoDB with the Drive ID and change the status to UPLOADED.
Error Handling:

If the upload to Drive fails, retry the upload later.
Implement a cleanup job for PENDING_UPLOAD records older than a certain time if they remain unresolved.
